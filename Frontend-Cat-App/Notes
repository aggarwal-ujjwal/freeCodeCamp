Close the tag with '/' forward slash.
<h1> and <h2> will trigger different size texts.

The h1 through h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements. Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.
The p element is used to create a paragraph of text on websites

Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts with <!--, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with -->. For example, the comment <!-- TODO: Remove h1 --> contains the text TODO: Remove h1.
HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

Identify the main section of this page by adding a <main> opening tag before the h1 element, and a </main> closing tag after the p element.

Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in. This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read.

You can add images to your website by using the img element. img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag.

HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located). An example of an img element using an src attribute: <img src="https://www.example.com/the-image.jpg">.
All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load. For example, <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat"> has an alt attribute with the text A cat
if the image is not loaded.

You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element. For example, <a href='https://freecodecamp.org'></a> would link to freecodecamp.org.
A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (a) element. For example, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org</a> is a link with the text click here to go to freeCodeCamp.org.

Step 12
In the previous step you turned the words link to cat pictures into a link by placing them between opening and closing anchor (a) tags. You can do the same to words inside of an element, such as a p element.
In the text of your p element, turn the words cat photos into a link to https://freecatphotoapp.com by adding opening and closing anchor (a) tags around these words.

dd a target attribute with the value _blank to the anchor (a) element's opening tag, so that the link opens in a new tab.

Can convert image into a link as well using anchor element anf href attribute.

Before adding any new content, you should make use of a section element to separate the cat photos content from the future content.
ul=unordered list, li->list

The figure element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption.
A figure caption (figcaption) element is used to add a caption to describe the image contained within the figure element. For example, <figcaption>A cute cat</figcaption> adds the caption A cute cat.

After the image nested in the figure element, add a figcaption element
<em> - emphases a word in caption

The code for an ordered list (ol) is similar to an unordered list, but list items in an ordered list are numbered when displayed
The strong element is used to indicate that some text is of strong importance or urgent

The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example, <form action="/submit-url"></form> tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path /submit-url.
The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like img elements, input elements are self-closing and do not need closing tags.
There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the type attribute. You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer.

In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted. For example, you could use the following syntax for an email address text field: <input type="text" name="email">.
Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input. For example, <input type="text" placeholder="Email address">.
(It will show this name in the text field)

To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the required attribute to an input element. There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. Instead, just add the word required to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.

Use the button element to create a clickable button. For example, <button>Click Here</button> creates a button with the text Click Here.
The default behavior of clicking a form button without any attributes submits the form to the location specified in the form's action attribute.
Even though you added your button below the text input, they appear next to each other on the page. That's because both input and button elements are inline elements, which don't appear on new lines.
The button you added will submit the form by default. However, relying on default behavior may cause confusion. Add the type attribute with the value submit to the button to make it clear that it is a submit button.

Remember that input elements are self-closing.(Like images)
You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options.

label elements are used to help associate the text for an input element with the input element itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers). For example, <label><input type="radio"> cat</label> makes it so clicking the word cat also selects the corresponding radio button.
Nest your radio button inside a label element.

The id attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. Each id attribute's value must be unique from all other id values for the entire page.
Add an id attribute with the value indoor to the radio button.

Imp-When elements have multiple attributes, the order of the attributes doesn't matter.
Notice that both radio buttons can be selected at the same time. To make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a name attribute with the same value.
Add a name attribute of same value to select only one of them.
