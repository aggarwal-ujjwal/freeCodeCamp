CSS

You can add style to an element by specifying it in the style element and setting a property for it like this:
element {
 property: value;
}
eg - h1{
         text-align: center;
         }
This will shift h1 to center

we can add more like h1,h2,p{} and all will follow the same style
As there will be many styles-> we make a separate css file not included in html

Now you need to link the styles.css file so the styles will be applied again. Nest a self-closing link element in the head element. Give it a rel attribute value stylesheet and an href attribute value of styles.css
