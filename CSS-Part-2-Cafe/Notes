CSS

You can add style to an element by specifying it in the style element and setting a property for it like this:
element {
 property: value;
}
eg - h1{
         text-align: center;
         }
This will shift h1 to center

we can add more like h1,h2,p{} and all will follow the same style
As there will be many styles-> we make a separate css file not included in html

Now you need to link the styles.css file so the styles will be applied again. Nest a self-closing link element in the head element. Give it a rel attribute value stylesheet and an href attribute value of styles.css

link is a self closing element in head

Step 17
For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a meta element with a special content attribute.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /> //Added for fitting the device width

Add another style to the file that changes the background-color property to brown for the body element.


The div element is used mainly for design layout purposes unlike the other content elements you have used so far. Add a div element inside the body element and then move all the other elements inside the new div.
The goal now is to make the div not take up the entire width of the page. The CSS width property is perfect for this. Create a new type selector in the style sheet that gives your div element a width of 300px.

The whole idea idea of div to use for design layout purposes.
